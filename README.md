# Covid 19 Vaccination Data Insights

This repository will host my COVID-19 vaccination reporting project. This was an Individual university project where, using open source COVID-19 API data sources from GitHub, and data science libraries in Python, I analyzed and generated graphical and verbal insights. The insights involved trend analysis of vaccination statuses for different age groups, comparing COVID-19 test counts between different methods of COVID testing, and analyzing confirmed COVID cases in America.
This repository will contain the jupyter notebook in which the project was created in.
